            <p>“Self-confidence boils down to a belief in yourself and having faith in your abilities,” says Ellen
                Hendriksen, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and author of How To Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and
                Rise Above Social Anxiety. And while self-confidence is often interchanged with the term self-esteem,
                the two feelings are actually not quite the same.</p>

            <P>
                This week, educators, students and the public around the world are participating in Computer Science
                Education Week by organizing and leading one-hour coding tutorials.

                By the start of the week, more than 2,700 Canadian coding events had been registered with Code.org, a
                not-for-profit organization in the United States that promotes the week.</P>
